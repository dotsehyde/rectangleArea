## Rectangle Area

### Written in Java 

The program should calculate the area of a rectangle using the following methods:

- `getLength` — This method should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s length, and then return that value as a double.

- `getWidth` — This method should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s width, and then return that value as a double.

- `getArea` — This method should accept the rectangle’s length and width as arguments, and return the rectangle’s area. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.

- `displayData` — This method should accept the rectangle’s length, width, and area as arguments, and display them in an appropriate message on the screen.
